To import an Unreal game template and create a game faster, follow these steps:

Open the Unreal Engine Editor and create a new project.

In the New Project dialog box, click on the "Blueprints" tab.

In the Blueprint tab, select the "Blank" project template.

Click on the "Create Project" button to create the new project.

Once the project has been created, go to the "Learn" tab in the main menu and select "Sample Games".

In the "Sample Games" section, you will find a variety of game templates that you can download and import into your project. Choose a game template that is closest to the type of game you want to create.

Click on the "Download" button next to the game template you want to import.

Once the game template has been downloaded, go to the "Library" tab in the Unreal Engine Editor and select "Add to Project".

Navigate to the location where you downloaded the game template and select the template file.

The game template will be imported into your project. You can now use it as a starting point to create your own game.

By importing a game template, you can save a lot of time and effort in creating a new game from scratch. The template will provide you with a basic framework that you can build upon and customize to create your own unique game.
