In LaTeX, the pipe character || is a special character that is used to denote parallel lines in math mode, and can also be used to create a table cell border in tabular mode. Therefore, if you want to print the pipe character as-is (i.e., without it being interpreted as a LaTeX command), you need to "escape" it using the backslash \ character.

To print the pipe character || in LaTeX, simply use the following syntax:

Copy code
\||
This will print the two pipe characters next to each other, without any space in between.
