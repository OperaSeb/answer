You can modify a file in C++ by opening it in "write" mode using the `std::ofstream` class. Here's an example:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>

int main() {
    std::fstream file("example.txt", std::ios::in | std::ios::out); // open file in read/write mode
    if (file.is_open()) { // check if file was opened successfully
        std::string line;
        while (std::getline(file, line)) { // read file line by line
            if (line == "world") { // replace "world" with "planet"
                file.seekp(-5, std::ios::cur); // move file pointer back 5 characters (to start of "world")
                file.write("planet", 6); // write "planet" to file
            }
        }
        file.close(); // close the file
        std::cout << "File modified successfully." << std::endl;
    }
    else {
        std::cout << "Failed to open file." << std::endl;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we create an `std::fstream` object named `file` and pass the name of the file we want to modify ("example.txt") to the constructor, along with the flags `std::ios::in` (to open the file in "input" mode) and `std::ios::out` (to open the file in "output" mode). We then check if the file was opened successfully using the `is_open()` method, and if so, we read the file line by line using the `std::getline()` function and store each line in a `std::string` variable named `line`. If the line contains the word "world", we move the file pointer back 5 characters using `seekp()` and overwrite the word "world" with "planet" using the `write()` method. Finally, we close the file using the `close()` method.

Note that in order to modify a file in-place like this, you need to open it in both "input" and "output" modes using `std::ios::in | std::ios::out` flag. Also, to move the file pointer back to the start of the word "world" we use a negative offset in the `seekp()` method. The `write()` method then overwrites the word "world" with "planet" by writing 6 characters (the length of "planet", including the null terminator) to the file.
