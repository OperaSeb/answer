I believe you meant to ask the difference between time complexity and space complexity.

Time complexity and space complexity are two different measures used to analyze the performance of algorithms. 

Time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. It measures how the running time of an algorithm increases with the size of the input. Time complexity is usually expressed using the big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the running time of an algorithm as a function of the input size.

Space complexity, on the other hand, refers to the amount of memory used by an algorithm to run as a function of the input size. It measures how much memory an algorithm requires to store and manipulate data during its execution. Space complexity is also usually expressed using the big O notation, which provides an upper bound on the amount of memory used by an algorithm as a function of the input size.

To summarize, the main difference between time complexity and space complexity is that time complexity measures the amount of time an algorithm takes to execute as a function of the input size, while space complexity measures the amount of memory an algorithm uses to execute as a function of the input size. Both time complexity and space complexity are important factors to consider when analyzing the performance of algorithms and can help in selecting the most appropriate algorithm for a given problem.
