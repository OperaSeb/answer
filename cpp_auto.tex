Sure, here are three simple examples of auto keyword usage in C++:

1. Using auto to deduce the variable type:
```cpp
auto x = 42;  // x is deduced to be of type int
auto y = 3.14; // y is deduced to be of type double
```

2. Using auto to simplify long type names:
```cpp
std::map<std::string, int> myMap;

// Using auto to simplify the type name
auto it = myMap.begin(); // it is deduced to be of type std::map<std::string, int>::iterator
```

3. Using auto in range-based for loop:
```cpp
std::vector<int> numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};

// Using auto in range-based for loop to simplify the type name
for (auto number : numbers) { // number is deduced to be of type int
    std::cout << number << std::endl;
}
```
Note that the `auto` keyword is a C++11 feature and it can improve code readability and reduce typing effort.
