Yes, you can install Kali Linux on a USB stick by creating a bootable USB drive using the Kali Linux ISO image. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

Select the appropriate settings, such as partition scheme and file system format, according to your preferences and the requirements of your system.
Click on the "Start" or "Create" button to begin the process.
Wait for the tool to finish creating the bootable USB drive, which may take several minutes depending on the speed of your computer and the size of the ISO image.
