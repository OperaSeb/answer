To move a file in Rust, you can use the `std::fs::rename` function from the standard library. Here's an example:

```rust
use std::fs;

fn main() -> std::io::Result<()> {
    fs::rename("old_file.txt", "new_file.txt")?;
    Ok(())
}
```

In this example, we use the `fs::rename` function to rename the file "old_file.txt" to "new_file.txt". If the operation succeeds, the function returns `Ok(())`. If the operation fails, the function returns an `Err` value containing the error information.

Note that the `fs::rename` function also supports moving a file between directories by specifying the full paths of the old and new locations.
